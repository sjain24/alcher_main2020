<p> 1. The game is played on a half-court, with one basket. A size 7 standard (749–780 mm/29.5–30.7 in) court will be used for the matches. </p>
<p> 2. The game is a single period of 10 minutes with sudden death at 21 points. The winner is the first team to score 21 or the team with the highest score at the end of the 10 minutes. </p>

<p> 1. Online registrations are advised. Offline registration is subject to availability and will be strictly based on "First Come First Serve" basis. Registrations are done at www.alcheringa.in/registrations .</p>
<p> 2. Each team consists of three players and one substitute. </p>
<p> 3. The minimum age limit for this competition is 15 years.</p>
<p> 4. A coin toss will be held immediately before the game. The winning team can choose to take possession of the ball at the start of the game, or take the first possession of a potential overtime period.</p>
<p> 5. There are no jump balls at any time in the game; neither is there an alternating possession rule. In any held ball situation, the defensive team is granted possession. Every successful shot inside the arc is awarded one point, while every successful shot behind the arc is awarded two points.</p>

<p> 6. A tie in regulation leads to an untimed overtime period, which is won by the first team to score points in overtime. If a foul is committed that results in the non-fouling team retaining possession i.e., a technical or "unsportsmanlike" foul - the non-fouling team will receive the exchange.</p>

<p> 7. A 12-second shot clock is used.If the defence gains possession of the ball within the arc, by a steal, a block or a rebound, the team must move the ball behind the arc before being allowed to take a shot.</p>
<p> 8. After a made basket or free throw, play restarts with a player from the non-scoring team taking the ball directly under the basket and dribbling or passing it to a point behind the arc.The defence is not allowed to play for the ball inside the block/charge semi-circle under the basket.</p>
<p> 9. Each team is allowed one timeout (The officials may still stop the game in case of player injury or other dangerous situations).Substitution is allowed only during a dead-ball situation.Individual personal foul counts are not kept.</p>

<p> 10. In other words, players cannot be disqualified on the basis of personal fouls.However, a player who commits two unsportsmanlike fouls is disqualified.Fouls during the act of shooting inside the arc are awarded 1 free throw, whilst fouls during the act of shooting behind the arc are awarded 2 free throws.Technical fouls (including unsportsmanlike fouls)result in two free throws plus possession of the ball. </p>
